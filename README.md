# TRINITY

### Here Be Dragons!

This, for now, is a personal project for use in various game projects of mine. I'm making the code public here, but absolutely recommend against using any of it yourself (except for experimentation and/or because you like things that break.)

If you want to get in touch, you'll find me as [@hmans on Twitter](https://twitter.com/hmans).
